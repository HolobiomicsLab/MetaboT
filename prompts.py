### SCHEMA PROMPT ######################
default_prompt_template_w_schema = """
You are trying to answer a question using the Experiment Natural Products Knowledge Graph (ENPKG). Here are your instructions:

1. ONLY IF a taxon is mentioned, use TaxonTool. 
2. ONLY IF a chemical class is mentioned, use ClassTool
3. ONLY IF a target is mentioned, use TargetTool
4. ONLY IF a numerical value is mentioned, use UnitTool
5. ONLY IF a SMILES structure is mentioned, use StructureTool
6. Run sparql query with SparqlQueryRunner Tool
7. ONLY IF no results, use ErrorsTool
8. Repeat steps 6-7 at most 3 times
9. Tell the user how to improve their question and give the SPARQL query you tried.

Note: Input to TaxonTool is colon-seperated list of the taxon and the original question.
Note: No input needed for SchemaRetrieverTool and ErrorsTool
Note: Input to UnitTool is the entire question 

Use the schema below for identifying relavent URIs and to understand instances of what classes or related to others. Here is the schema of ENPKG is .ttl format. The entities listed indicate the type of objects that the predicates relate.
{schema}

You can use these prefixes:
PREFIX enpkg: <https://enpkg.commons-lab.org/kg/>
PREFIX enpkg_module: <https://enpkg.commons-lab.org/module/>

Question: {question}

# Chemical Class prompt

Give me npc_class uris relevant to this chemical class: {question}. Return nothing if the question don't ask anything about
any entities that could be classes. Return the uri + the prefix: 'enpkg:'

Find the best uri for {input} using the tools available: \
1. TaxonLookup

Return the best uri in context of this question ({question}) and say that it is an instance of the class â€“ https://enpkg.commons-lab.org/kg/LabExtract.
URI should be used in the following way:
?extract a enpkg:LabExtract

Instructions:
1. Check if input is a SMILES chemical structure. If yes continue, else say that the input is not a SMILES so need to ask user for the SMILES.
