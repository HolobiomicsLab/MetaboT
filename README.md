## Installation Guide 🚀

### Prerequisites

1. **Conda Installation**  
   - Ensure Conda (Anaconda/Miniconda) is installed.  
   - [Conda Installation Docs](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/install/)

2. **API Keys**
   Required API keys:
   - Get an API key for your chosen language model:
     - **OpenAI API Key**: Get it from [OpenAI Platform](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys)
     - **DeepSeek API Key**: Get it from DeepSeek
     - **Claude API Key**: Get it from Anthropic
     - Or other models supported by [LiteLLM](https://docs.litellm.ai/docs/providers)

   > **Disclaimer:** Most LLM APIs are commercial and paid services. Our default model is **gpt-4o**, and its usage will incur costs according to the provider's pricing policy.
   >
   > **Data Privacy:** Please note that data submitted to LLM APIs is subject to their respective privacy policies. Avoid sending sensitive or confidential information, as data may be logged for quality assurance and research purposes.

   Optional API keys:
   - **LangSmith API Key**: This is used to see the interactions traces [LangSmith](https://smith.langchain.com/). This is free.

   Create a `.env` file in the root directory with your credentials:

   ```bash
   OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_key_here
   LANGCHAIN_API_KEY=your_langsmith_key_here
   LANGCHAIN_ENDPOINT=https://api.smith.langchain.com
   LANGCHAIN_PROJECT=metabot_project 
   ```
   **Note:** The system can also be used with other LLM models, namely: Meta-Llama-3_1-70B-Instruct and deepseek-reasoner. For Meta-Llama-3_1-70B-Instruct (which runs on OVH Cloud – see [OVH Cloud](https://www.ovh.com/)), add the API key OVHCLOUD_API_KEY to your `.env` file; for deepseek-reasoner, add DEEPSEEK_API_KEY. Currently, all agents use the OpenAI model gpt-4o (including the SPARQL generation chain). Furthermore, if the initial query yields no results, a SPARQL improvement chain using the OpenAI o3-mini model is activated.

### Installation Steps

1. **Clone the Repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/holobiomicslab/MetaboT.git
   cd MetaboT
   git checkout dev
   ```

2. **Create and Activate the Conda Environment**  

   For macOS:
   ```bash
   conda env create -f environment.yml
   conda activate metaboT
   ```

   For Linux:
   ```bash
   # Update system dependencies first
   sudo apt-get update
   sudo apt-get install -y python3-dev build-essential
  
   # Then create and activate the conda environment
   conda env create -f environment.yml
   conda activate MetaboT
   ```

    For Windows (using WSL):

   Install WSL if you haven't already:

      ```bash
      wsl --install
      ```
      
   Open WSL and install the required packages:

      ```bash
      sudo apt-get update
      sudo apt-get install -y python3-dev build-essential
      ```
      
   Install Miniconda in WSL:

      ```bash
      wget https://repo.anaconda.com/miniconda/Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh
      bash Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh
      source ~/.bashrc
      ```
      
   Create and activate the conda environment:
      ```bash
      conda env create -f environment.yml
      conda activate MetaboT
      ``` 
     
 > Pro-tip: If you hit any issues with psycopg2, the `environment.yml` uses `psycopg2-binary` for maximum compatibility.

## Application Startup Instructions ▶️

The application is structured as a Python module with dot notation imports—so choose your style, whether absolute (e.g., `app.core.module1.module2`) or relative (e.g., `..core.module1.module2`).

### Demo

To launch the application, use Python's `-m` option. The main entry point is in `app.core.main`.

To try one of the [standard questions](app/data/standard_questions.txt), run the following command:
 
```bash
cd MetaboT
python -m app.core.main -q 1
```
Here, the number following `-q` specifies the question number from the standard questions which can be viewed in `app/data/standard_questions.txt`.
Expected output includes runtime metrics and a welcoming prompt. 😎

### Running with a Custom Question

```bash
python -m app.core.main -c "Your custom question"
```
### Running via Streamlit

To launch the application through Streamlit, set the required environment variables, install the dependencies, and run the app. In your terminal, execute:

```bash
export ADMIN_OPENAI_KEY=your_openai_api_key
export LANGCHAIN_API_KEY=your_langchain_api_key
pip install -r requirements.txt
streamlit run streamlit_webapp/streamlit_app.py
```

If you encounter an error stating that the `app` directory cannot be found (e.g., "ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'app'"), it means Python is unable to locate the module. To resolve this, add the current directory to your `PYTHONPATH` by running:

```bash
export PYTHONPATH="${PYTHONPATH}:$(pwd)"
```

This command ensures that Python can locate the `app` directory.

---
### Running in Docker

If you prefer to run the application in a containerized environment, Docker support is provided. Make sure Docker and docker-compose are installed on your system.

#### Building the Docker Image

To build the Docker image, run:

```bash
docker-compose build
```

#### Running the Application

To launch the application and run the first standard question, execute:

```bash
docker-compose run metabot python -m app.core.main -q 1
```

This command will start the container, run the application inside Docker, and process the first standard question from [app/data/standard_questions.txt]. You can adjust parameters as needed.

## Agent Setup Guidelines 🧑‍💻

### Agent Directory Creation
Create a dedicated folder for your agent within the `app/core/agents/` directory. See [here](https://github.com/holobiomicslab/MetaboT/blob/main/app/core/agents).

### Standard File Structure
- **Agent (`agent.py`)**: Copy from an existing agent unless your tool requires private class property access. Refer to "If Your Tool Serves as an Agent" for special cases.  
  > Psst... don't let the complexities of Python imports overcomplicate your flow—trust the process!

- **Prompt (`prompt.py`)**: Adapt the prompt for your specific context/tasks. Configure the `MODEL_CHOICE`, default is `llm-o` for *gpt-4o* (per [`app/config/params.ini`](https://github.com/holobiomicslab/MetaboT/blob/main/app/config/params.ini)).

- **Tools (`tool_xxxx.py`)** (optional): Inherit from the LangChain `BaseTool`, defining:
  - `name`, `description`, `args_schema`
  - A Pydantic model for input validation
  - The `_run` method for execution

### Supervisor Configuration
Modify the supervisor prompt (see [supervisor prompt](https://github.com/holobiomicslab/MetaboT/blob/main/app/core/agents/supervisor/prompt.py)) to detect and select your agent. Our AI PR-Agent 🤖 is triggered automatically through issues and pull requests, so you'll be in good hands!

### Configuration Updates
Update `app/config/langgraph.json` to include your agent in the workflow. For reference, see [langgraph.json](https://github.com/holobiomicslab/MetaboT/tree/main/app/config/langgraph.json).

### If Your Tool Serves as an Agent
For LLM-interaction, make sure additional class properties are set in `agent.py` (refer to [tool_sparql.py](https://github.com/holobiomicslab/MetaboT/blob/main/app/core/agents/sparql/tool_sparql.py) and [agent.py](https://github.com/holobiomicslab/MetaboT/blob/main/app/core/agents/sparql/agent.py)). Keep it snazzy and smart!

## Development Guidelines

**Contributing to 🧪 MetaboT 🍵**

We use the `dev` branch for pushing our contributions [here on GitHub](https://github.com/holobiomicslab/MetaboT/tree/dev). Please create your own branch (either user-centric like `dev_benjamin` or feature-centric like `dev_langgraph`) and submit a pull request to the `dev` branch when you're ready for review. Our AI PR-Agent 🤖 is always standing by to help trigger pull requests and even handle issues smartly—because why not let a smarty pants bot lend a hand.

**Documentation Standards**
- Use **Google Docstring Format**  
- Consider the **Mintlify Doc Writer for VSCode** for automatically stylish and precise docstrings.

**Code Formatting**
- Stick to **PEP8**
- Leverage the **Black Formatter** for a neat, uniform style.

> Because code deserves to look as sharp as your ideas. 😎

### Good Practices with Keys
Pass keys as parameters instead of environment variables for scalable production deployments.

---

## Logging Guidelines

Centralized logging resides in `app/config/logging.ini`. See [here](https://github.com/holobiomicslab/MetaboT/blob/main/app/config/logging.ini).

Use the following snippet at the start of your Python scripts:
```python
from pathlib import Path
import logging.config

parent_dir = Path(__file__).parent.parent
config_path = parent_dir / "config" / "logging.ini"
logging.config.fileConfig(config_path, disable_existing_loggers=False)
logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)
```
*Pro-tip:* Use `logger` over `print` for more elegant and traceable output.
