# Agents API Reference ü§ñ

This document details the agent system in the application, including the specialized agents and their roles in processing queries.

## Common Architecture

All agents in the system share a similar architectural pattern and are managed by the agent factory ([`app.core.agents.agents_factory`](https://github.com/HolobiomicsLab/MetaboT/blob/main/app/core/agents/agents_factory.py)):

**Core Components:**

- **Dynamic Agent Creation**: Loads agent modules based on configuration settings
- **Flexible Parameter Handling**: Uses introspection to pass only required parameters to each agent
- **LLM Selection**: Supports configuration-based and agent-specific LLM selection
- **Session Management**: Maintains consistent session IDs across the agent ecosystem
- **Error Handling**: Provides robust logging and exception handling

### Core Factory Function

The `create_all_agents` function serves as the entry point for initializing the entire agent ecosystem:

```python
def create_all_agents(llms, graph, openai_key=None, session_id=None):
    """
    Dynamically create and initialize all agent modules as specified in the configuration.
    
    Parameters:
        llms (dict): A dictionary mapping LLM keys to their instances.
        graph: The graph instance used by the agents.
        openai_key (str, optional): The OpenAI API key to be used by agents.
        session_id (str, optional): A unique session identifier.
        
    Returns:
        dict: A dictionary mapping agent names to their created executor instances.
    """
```
## Individual Agent Architecture

Each agent in the system follows a consistent structural pattern while maintaining specialized functionality.

### Common Agent Components

- **Creation Function**: Each agent implements a `create_agent` function that returns an `AgentExecutor`
- **Tool Management**: Dynamically loads tools from its directory using the `import_tools` utility
- **Role-Specific Prompts**: Defines behavior through customized prompts
- **LLM Integration**: Utilizes language models as reasoning engines
- **Logging**: Implements consistent logging for monitoring and debugging

### Standard Agent Structure

```python
def create_agent(llms, graph, openai_key, llm_instance=None) -> AgentExecutor:
    """
    Creates and configures an agent with its specialized tools.
    
    Parameters:
        llms (dict): Available language models.
        graph: The knowledge graph instance.
        openai_key (str): API key for OpenAI services.
        llm_instance: Optional specific LLM instance to use.
        
    Returns:
        AgentExecutor: A configured agent executor instance.
    """
    # Load tools dynamically from the agent's directory
    # Configure the agent with appropriate prompts
    # Return an AgentExecutor instance
```

## Agent Interaction Architecture üîÑ

The agent system is implemented using [LangGraph](https://www.langchain.com/langgraph)'s StateGraph, where agents operate as nodes in a directed graph with state-managed transitions.

**Core Architecture:**
```python
class AgentState(TypedDict):
    messages: Annotated[Sequence[BaseMessage], operator.add]  # Accumulated messages
    next: str  # Next routing target
```

**Workflow Components:**

1. Graph Structure:
    - Entry_Agent as the designated entry point
    - Nodes representing individual agents
    - Conditional edges defining valid transitions
    - State preservation across transitions

2. Routing Logic:
    - Entry_Agent can route to Supervisor or Validator
    - Validator makes routing decisions based on query validation
    - Supervisor dynamically routes to specialized agents
    - Process ends when valid response generated or error detected

3. State Management:
      - Messages accumulate throughout processing
      - Each agent adds its output to message history
      - State maintained across all transitions
      - Metadata preserved for context

**Communication Patterns:**

1. Primary Flow:
   ```
   Entry_Agent ‚Üí Validator ‚Üí Supervisor ‚Üí [Specialized Agents] ‚Üí __end__
   ```

2. Conditional Branching:
    * Validator routes based on query validity
    * Supervisor routes based on query content analysis
    * Dynamic routing to specialized agents as needed

3. Message Handling:
    * Human messages initiate workflow
    * Agent responses added to message sequence
    * State updates trigger next agent selection
    * Final response terminates workflow

**This architecture ensures:**

  * Clear communication paths
  * Stateful processing
  * Dynamic routing
  * Error handling
  * Process monitoring

## Agent Setup Guidelines üßë‚Äçüíª

### Agent Directory Creation
Create a dedicated folder for your agent within the [`app/core/agents/`](https://github.com/holobiomicslab/MetaboT/blob/main/app/core/agents) directory.

### Standard File Structure
- **Agent (`agent.py`)**: Copy from an existing agent unless your tool requires private class property access. Refer to "If Your Tool Serves as an Agent" for special cases.
  > Psst... don't let the complexities of Python imports overcomplicate your flow‚Äîtrust the process!

- **Prompt (`prompt.py`)**: Adapt the prompt for your specific context/tasks.

- **Tools (`tool_xxxx.py`)** (optional): Inherit from the LangChain `BaseTool`, defining:
    - `name`, `description`, `args_schema`
    - A Pydantic model for input validation
    - The `_run` method for execution

### Supervisor Configuration
Modify the supervisor prompt (see [supervisor prompt](https://github.com/holobiomicslab/MetaboT/blob/main/app/core/agents/supervisor/prompt.py)) to detect and select your agent. Our AI PR-Agent ü§ñ is triggered automatically through issues and pull requests, so you'll be in good hands!

### Configuration Updates
Update [`app/config/langgraph.json`](https://github.com/HolobiomicsLab/MetaboT/blob/main/app/config/langgraph.json) to include your agent in the workflow and specify `llm_choice` based on the models defined in [`app/config/params.ini`](https://github.com/HolobiomicsLab/MetaboT/blob/main/app/config/params.ini). Available models include:

- OpenAI models: `llm_preview`, `llm_o`, `llm_mini`
- OVH models: `ovh_Meta-Llama-3_1-70B-Instruct`
- Deepseek models: `deepseek_deepseek-chat`, `deepseek_deepseek-reasoner`
- LiteLLM compatible models: `llm_litellm_openai`, `llm_litellm_deepseek`, `llm_litellm_claude`, `llm_litellm_gemini`

Choose the appropriate model based on your agent's requirements for reasoning capabilities and performance. For reference, see [langgraph.json](https://github.com/holobiomicslab/MetaboT/tree/main/app/config/langgraph.json). If you need to add a new language model, refer to the [Language Model Configuration](../getting-started/installation.md#language-model-configuration) guide.

### If Your Tool Serves as an Agent
For LLM-interaction, make sure additional class properties are set in `agent.py` (refer to [tool_sparql.py](https://github.com/holobiomicslab/MetaboT/blob/main/app/core/agents/sparql/tool_sparql.py) and [agent.py](https://github.com/holobiomicslab/MetaboT/blob/main/app/core/agents/sparql/agent.py)). Keep it snazzy and smart!
