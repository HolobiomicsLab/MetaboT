# Welcome to MetaboT üöÄ

MetaboT is a powerful metabolomics analysis tool that leverages advanced AI and graph-based approaches for metabolomics data analysis and interpretation.

## Key Features ‚ú®

- **AI-Powered Analysis** :robot:: Utilizes LangChain and various AI agents for intelligent data processing.
- **Graph-Based Architecture** :chart_with_upwards_trend:: Built on robust graph management systems for complex data relationships.
- **SPARQL Integration** :link:: Advanced querying capabilities for metabolomics data.
- **Extensible Framework** :wrench:: Modular design allowing for easy extension and customization.

## Project Overview üî¨

MetaboT is designed to help researchers and scientists in:

- Processing and analyzing metabolomics data.
