# Welcome to MetaboT

MetaboT is a powerful metabolomics analysis tool that leverages advanced AI and graph-based approaches for metabolomics data analysis and interpretation.

## Key Features

- **AI-Powered Analysis**: Utilizes LangChain and various AI agents for intelligent data processing
- **Graph-Based Architecture**: Built on robust graph management systems for complex data relationships
- **SPARQL Integration**: Advanced querying capabilities for metabolomics data
- **Extensible Framework**: Modular design allowing for easy extension and customization

## Project Overview

MetaboT is designed to help researchers and scientists in:

- Processing and analyzing metabolomics data
- Identifying complex patterns and relationships
- Generating insights from metabolomics experiments
- Managing and querying large-scale metabolomics datasets
